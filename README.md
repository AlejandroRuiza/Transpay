# Transpay
Scheduled Payments, Transparent Movements, Agile Response.

An online platform for making all payments and slow processes more efficient and agile.

# What is next for Transpay?

Our team is conformed by people in the Computer Engineering field, passionate about technology, and aware of the great things we can do with it.

As part of our design process and brainstorming we took on the task of validating the project technically with experts in the area, thus achieving a first acceptance to integrate our development into possible services in our city.

Therefore, as the next stage of our project, we decided not to stay here only with the idea, but to implement it in our services and make financial processes, bureaucratic processes, purchases, among other movements, more efficient.

In addition to our passion for implementing our project, we know that there is a long way to go, as well as technologies and tools to explore, such as the Block-chain option, starting a service network with payments by crypto-currency, implementing discounts in local businesses through of payments on our platform as a means of promotion and dissemination and many more activities.

We will continue to develop new ideas and applications to be able to move forward as a society, from this contingency, as well as in the future that awaits us.

The Transpay team sends you greetings, and wishes you the best in this ongoing health situation. 

Together we are stronger.
